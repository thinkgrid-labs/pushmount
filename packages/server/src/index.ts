/**
 * @aghoz/server
 *
 * Server push that mounts into an application you already have. The hub is an object
 * in your process, so your existing authentication middleware runs before it and
 * authorization is a function of the request you already parsed.
 *
 * `createHub` is the entry point; the protocol primitives below it are exported for
 * adapters and tests.
 *
 * Zero runtime dependencies, by design — see DECISIONS.md D2. The protocol core
 * (`hub.ts`, `registry.ts`) performs no IO at all; only `create-hub.ts` touches sockets,
 * which is what keeps the corpus able to own the parts that must never diverge.
