/**
 * The hub core — PROTOCOL.md §2, §3, §6, §10.
 *
 * This module owns the parts of the protocol that must be identical everywhere: id
 * assignment, topic validation, frame encoding, and the history ring. It performs no
 * IO and knows nothing about HTTP; the handler layer owns sockets.
 *
 * This is TypeScript rather than a binding to the Rust core, so that installing the
 * package needs no prebuild, no `.node` file and no toolchain — DECISIONS.md D2, as
 * amended by D3, which made Rust the shared core for *other* languages rather than a
 * replacement for this one. `createHub({ core: createNativeCore(native) })` swaps in the
 * Rust core for anyone who wants it.
 *
 * That arrangement rests entirely on `conformance/vectors.json` remaining the arbiter:
 * the Rust core already reads the same corpus, and both must keep passing it. **Do not
 * add behaviour here that the corpus does not pin down** — an unpinned rule is one the
 * two implementations will eventually answer differently, which has happened three times
 * already (D6, D9, D10).
