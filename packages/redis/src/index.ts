/**
 * @aghoz/redis — a backplane on Redis Streams.
 *
 * Streams are the right primitive rather than pub/sub, for one reason that decides
 * everything else: **`XADD` assigns exactly the `<ms>-<seq>` id this protocol uses**.
 * §2 fixed that format so a shared sequencer could issue it, and Redis is that
 * sequencer — no per-process counter, no collision between pods, no client silently
 * discarding a real event as already-seen.
 *
 * The stream is also the shared history, so `XRANGE key (cursor +` is the replay a
 * client needs after reconnecting to a different process. Pub/sub would give fan-out
 * and nothing else: no ids, no history, no way to answer "did I miss anything".
 *
 * The Redis client is injected rather than imported, so this package has no third-party
 * runtime dependency and works with ioredis, node-redis, or anything presenting the
 * same handful of commands.

   *
   * - A stream that has never trimmed still has an oldest entry, and every cursor below

   *   despite nothing having been dropped. That is a `~gap` on every cold page load, and

   * - A stream that has been deleted, expired, evicted whole by `maxmemory`, or lost to a
   *   failover onto a replica that never received the writes has no oldest entry at all.
   *   With nothing to compare against, total loss compares as "you missed nothing" —
   *   silent staleness, which is the one failure §0 exists to eliminate.
   *
   * Redis trims implicitly on `XADD`, so the newest evicted id is not observable and no
   * amount of reading the stream recovers it. What is recoverable is whether anything was
   * evicted *at all*, which needs one durable fact the stream itself does not carry: the
   * id it began with. That is the `<key>:floor` marker, and everything below reduces to
   * it. Where the exact watermark would still be needed — a cursor sitting precisely on
   * the last evicted id, which §4.4 says to echo — this reports a gap instead. That is a
