/**
 * @aghoz/svelte
 *
 * One connection for the whole app, and a store where you render.
 *
 * A thin wrapper over `@aghoz/client`: it owns reactivity and lifetime, and nothing else.
 * Every protocol decision — gap detection, replay, the cursor — belongs to the client and
 * is not restated here.
 *
 * ## Stores rather than runes
 *
 * These are `svelte/store` readables, which work unchanged in Svelte 4 and Svelte 5 and
 * are plain JavaScript — no `.svelte.js` file, no compiler step in this package's build,
 * and no rune syntax that pins it to one major version. Svelte 5 still auto-subscribes to
 * a store with `$topicStore`, so the rendering code is identical either way.
 *
 * It also buys the lifetime for free. A readable's start function runs on the first
 * subscriber and its returned teardown runs when the last one leaves, so `$` auto-
 * subscription in a component *is* the subscription lifecycle: nothing to remember to
 * clean up, and no leak when a component is destroyed.
