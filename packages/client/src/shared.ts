/**
 * One connection for every tab of an origin — PROTOCOL.md §9.1.
 *
 * Five tabs is currently five connections, five replay scans on every reconnect, and five
 * of the browser's six HTTP/1.1 slots. This holds the stream in one tab and fans out to
 * the rest over a `BroadcastChannel`.
 *
 * ## Election
 *
 * The leader is **whoever holds a Web Lock**, and nothing else. Every tab requests the
 * same exclusive lock and never releases it; the browser grants it to one, queues the
 * rest, and — this is the whole reason — hands it to the next in line the moment the
 * holder's tab goes away, including on a crash or a force-quit that runs no unload
 * handler.
 *
 * So there is no election protocol here, no heartbeat and no timeout to tune. That
 * matters more for this library than for most: a heartbeat election has to pick a
 * liveness timeout, and both ends of that choice are bad. Too short and a garbage-collect
 * pause in the leader elects a second one, so the same event is delivered twice from two
 * connections. Too long and every tab is blind for the timeout after a crash — which is
 * silent staleness, the one failure §0 exists to eliminate, reintroduced by the very
 * feature meant to be an optimisation.
 *
 * Where `navigator.locks` is missing there is no fallback, on purpose: [`createClient`]
 * is used per tab, exactly as before. Degrading to more connections is correct and
 * boring; degrading to a guessed timeout is neither.
 *
 * Every browser this library targets has it, and so does Node 24 — Node 22 has a
 * `navigator` with no `locks` on it, which is worth knowing when testing, because the two
 * take different paths through the constructor.
 *
 * ## Handoff
 *
 * Every tab tracks the cursor of every event the leader forwards, whether or not it has a
 * handler for that topic. A tab promoted to leader therefore already knows where the
 * shared stream had reached, and resumes from it. Anything the old leader received but
 * had not broadcast is re-delivered by the server's replay and deduped by id, which is
 * the same trade §4.5 already makes locally.
 *
 * ## Membership
 *
 * What the cursor does not carry is *who else is here*. Only the leader tracks which tab
 * wants which topics, and a lock handoff conveys one bit — that is the whole reason to
 * use one. So a new leader announces itself and every tab answers with its topics, which
 * is the only protocol in this file. Rebuilding the union from the answers is what makes
 * it safe: a tab that has gone away cannot answer, so there is no stale registry to prune
 * and no way for a tab that did not move to quietly leave the union.
