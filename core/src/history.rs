    ///
    /// - A ring that has never trimmed still has an oldest entry, and every cursor below
    ///   it compared as truncated even though nothing was dropped. `0-0`, the cold-start
    ///   cursor §5 hands out, is below every real id — so the documented first-page-load
    ///   path reported a gap to a client that had missed nothing.
    /// - A single frame larger than the whole budget is evicted on the push that added
    ///   it, leaving the ring *empty*. With no oldest entry there was nothing to compare
    ///   against, so a real loss was reported as "nothing missed" — silent staleness,
    ///   which is the one failure this protocol exists to eliminate.
    ///
    /// Kept as a maximum rather than "the last one evicted" so that an out-of-order
    /// `append` — a backplane replaying into the ring — can only push the mark forward.
