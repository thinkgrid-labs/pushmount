//! The stable C ABI over [`aghoz_core`].
//!
//! Every language binding targets this surface — napi for Node, PyO3 or ctypes for
//! Python, cgo for Go, FFI for Ruby. It is the expensive thing to change, so it is
//! deliberately small: a handle, three operations, and accessors for what they return.
//!
//! Three rules hold everywhere in this file, and breaking any of them is a soundness
//! bug rather than a style question:
//!
//! 1. **No panic crosses the boundary.** Unwinding into C is undefined behaviour, so
//!    every entry point is wrapped in [`std::panic::catch_unwind`] and turns a panic
//!    into [`AG_ERR_PANIC`].
//! 2. **Nothing is assumed null-terminated.** Every string is a pointer and a length.
//!    Payloads may legitimately contain NUL — §3 forbids it in *topics*, not in data —
//!    and a `strlen` here would silently truncate user content.
//! 3. **Rust allocations are freed by Rust.** Anything handed out has a matching
//!    `*_free`; callers must never `free()` it themselves.
//!
//! `aghoz-core` is `forbid(unsafe_code)` and stays that way. **All of the unsafe in
//! the project lives here, in one auditable file**, and it is all one of three shapes:
//! turn a caller's pointer+length into a slice, read through a pointer the caller
//! promised is valid, or write a result through an out-pointer.
//!
//! A C ABI cannot be written without unsafe — dereferencing a caller-supplied pointer
//! is unsafe by definition, and that is the entire content of an FFI boundary. What can
//! be done is to make it small, uniform, and verified: `unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn` is
//! denied below so no operation hides inside an `unsafe fn` signature, and CI runs the
//! ABI test suite under Miri, which actually executes these paths looking for undefined
//! behaviour rather than trusting review.

// These names appear verbatim in `include/aghoz.h` and in every binding's
// declarations. Renaming them to Rust convention would make the two disagree.
#![allow(non_camel_case_types)]
// An `unsafe fn` does not implicitly make its body an unsafe block: every dereference
// must be spelled out, so none of them can be added later without review noticing.
